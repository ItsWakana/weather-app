# weather-app

This project was a healthy dive into more asynchronous function flow. I had to fetch an object from the weather app using the users input so I needed to plan my program flow according to promise fulfilment.

I have used a combination of async functions and normal promise .then functionality. I found that using catch blocks a very effective way of handling my errors in this instance. When the user enters an invalid location we alert them that it is returning no results.

I hope to continue to practice using async for other projects in the future. I really enjoyed working with Web API's in this case.
